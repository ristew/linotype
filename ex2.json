Those ropes\nmy men cut and destroyed In four nipa\nhouses on the banks of the river which had\nbeen used as barracks by the insurgents 1\nfound over hundred pounds of fresh beef,\nwhich l ordered to be thrown in the river,\nand a hundred and fifty pounds of rice,\nwhich l confiscated. 1 ordered those houses\nburned and proceeded down the river.\nWhen within quarter of a mile from Ca\ntubig noise of an engagement could be\nheard coming from that direction. and 1\nordered the captain of the steamer to run\nhis boat at full speed, and We steamed into\ndirection.

Dey, 43d United\nStates Volunteer Infantry. of the remark\nable experience of the garrison at Catubig,\nin the Philippine Islands. in which a party\nof thirty-one enlisted men of Company H\nof that regiment maintained a successful\ndefense against an attacking force esti-\nmated at over go insurgents. beginning\nSunday morning. April 10. and lasting until\nrescued by a party under the command of\nFirst Lieutenant Sweeney of that regiment.\non Thursday afternoon, April 49, during\nwhich the party sustained a loss of eighteen\nmen killed and five wounded, while con-\nservative estimate of the number of insur-\ngents killed is upward of 200.\n\n\nCatubig, at which this affair occurred, is\na small town on the Island of Samar.\nwhich is the extreme easternmost island of\nthe Viscaya group, lying to the southeast\nof LuZon, and about ten miles interior from\nthe extreme north coast of that island,\nfifty-six miles from Catbalogan, the cap\nital of the province. and 1913 miles east\nsoutheast from Manila, and had a popula-\nton at the time of the last Spanish census\noe 1855. The people of this island Eave\nreputation of being of warlike disposition,\nferocious in their nature and exceedingly\ntreacherOus. Although the SpaniGrds had\nlocal governor at Catbalogan. they never\nwere able to entirely suppress the people.\nThe trade was principally in hemp and CO.\ncoanut oil.\n\n\nFirst Lieut.. Joseph T. Sweeney the Of\nficer who commanded the relief party is\nnative of New York city and served during\nthe Spanish-American war as second lieu\ntenant of the 69th New York, with which\nregiment he was Eonorab.y mustered out\nJanuary 81. 1899. and was commissioned\nsecond lieutenant In the Add on the 14th\nof August. 1892 and promoted to first lieu\ntIN E.h of n1tN\n\n\nSergt. Dustin L. George, who commanded\nthe small party at CGtubig at the time of\nthe attack, Is a resident of Barre. VT, be-\ning son of Mrs Jennie NJ. Northup of No.\n174 Merchant street. Barre, VT: he was n\nmarried. Corporal Antkony ]. Carson. who.\nafter the death of Sergts. George and Hall.\nsucceeded to the command, and who is so\nhighly commended by Capt. Dey. is a resi-\ndent of Maiden. Mass. at which place he\nenlisted October 5, 1899, having formerly\nserved in Company F. Goth New York Vol\nuntcers. during the SpGZish-Amcrican war,\nat which time he gave his nearest relative\nas Mrs. David F. Carroll, No. 80 James\nstreet, Maiden, Mass.\n\n\nCapt. Dey's Report.\n\n\nCaptain Deys report is dated at Laguan.\nApril p, and is in part as follows:\n\n\nabout $50 am. Sunday, April Is, the\ngarrison was alarmed by shots coming\nfrom the rear of the church on the left\n\n\n\n\n\nprepared to resist the attack. Almost at\nthe same time a heavy fire was opened on\nthem from the hills on the right and left\nand also from every available part of the\ncity which could be utilized by the insurgents.\nThis fire was kept up all day long, but the\ngarrison. with great courage and coolness.\nmet and returned the fire. with the result\nthat several insurgents were killed or\nAll during the night the firing was kept up,\nbut not quite so heavy as during the day.\n\n\nAbout am. on Monday the firing was\nresumed, and each hour went by 1t be-\ncame more general. AT about am. they\ncommenced firing a cannon which was\nplanted on the hill to the right of the bar\nracks using cut nails and spikes for pro-\njectiles. Sergeant George who command\ned the garrison, ordered all the. fire from\nthe barracks to be concentrated on this can\nnon for the purpose of silencing 1t. and after\ntwo voleys had been fired succeeded in\nhis purpose. Heavy rifle firing was kept up\nall day and until about II pm. when 1t\nlessened up until daylight Tuesday morn\ning, at which time the heavy firing was re-\nsumed, about am. from the front and\nacross the river from the cannon. the cam\nnon having been changed to this new posi-\nton during the night: but few wel!-di-\nrected shots from the garrison silenced 1t\nfor the time being. Up to this time but one\nman of the garrison had been wounded,\nPrivate Lee, who was shot on the left arm,\nbut a great number of insurgents had been\nkilled. some from their position in trees,\nsome from trying to charge the barracks.\n\n\nAbout this time a large number of in\nsurgents had managed to make their way\ninto the church adjoining the barracks,\nand were causing SO much trouble that 1t\nbecame necessary to silence them Ser\ngeant George called for ten men to charge\nthe church and drive them out. The men\nImmediately responded. and under terri\nbly, heavy fire from all sides they succeeded\nin getting in. and finding nearly hundred\ninsurgents there Immediately poured sew\nIII ;,to tt,ayV, iycr\nDer. By this time all the firing was CEN\ntered the church. and Sergeant George,\nfinding that to remain longer would be\nfatal to his little band. retreated back to\nthe barracks. This brave deed was accom-\nplished without the loss of a single man.\nThe firing became SO heavy and the terri\nBILE strain on the men so great from their\nlong and continuous fighting that 1t re-\nquired them to put forth their greatest ef-\nforts to meet this heavy fire.\n\n\nThe Barracks Fired.\n\n\nabout this time the insurgents had man\naged to regain the church. and from the\nwindows made several unsuccessful efforts\nto set fire to the barracks. Finally they\nmanaged to throw some hemp saturated\nwith oil against the building and succeeded\nIn setting fire to It. All efforts to subdue\nthis fire proved unavailing, and when the\nbuilding became untenable. the heat being\n50 intense, the garrison hastily decided the\nonly course open to them was to make\ndash for the river and attempt to get\nacross. hoping to intrench themselves on\nthe opposite shore. They destroyed every\nthing which would be of value to the In\nsurgents, divided the ammunition between\nthem. cut hole in the floor and dropped\nthrough one at time to the basement be-\nlow. When all of them had gotten through\nthey made a rush for the river. Some OF\nthem were killed before they reached the\nriver. Corporal Carson. with fifteen men.\nImmediately started to build trench, using\ntheir bayonets to dig with. The rest Of the\nmen attempted to cross the river. but were\nall killed while getting in the boat\n\n\nHeld Trench for Two Days.\n\n\nFor two days Corporal Carson and his\nsquad held this trench. fighting all the\ntime against great odds and having two\nmen killed and three wounded. one OF\nwhom. Sergeant Hall. has since died. until\nhe was finally rescued on Thursday morn\ning by Lieutenant Sweeney and his de-\ntachment. His report accompanies this\none and shows the difficulties which he en-\ncountered in the rescue. conservative\nestimate of the number of insurgents killed\nis upward of 900. but have no record Of the\nnumber of wounded. The loss we sustained\nIs eighteen killed and five wounded, one of\nwhom has since died. l also lost q large\namount of ordnance stores. quartermaster\nand commissary supplies, of which 1 will\nsubmit certificate to the officers Of those\ndepartments.",

Almost at\nthe same time a heavy fire was opened on\nthem from the hills on the right and left\nand also from every available part of the\ncity which could be utilized by the insurgents.\nThis fire was kept up all day long, but the\ngarrison. with great courage and coolness.\nmet and returned the fire. with the result\nthat several insurgents were killed or\nAll during the night the firing was kept up,\nbut not quite so heavy as during the day.\n\n\nAbout am. on Monday the firing was\nresumed, and each hour went by 1t be-\ncame more general. AT about am. they\ncommenced firing a cannon which was\nplanted on the hill to the right of the bar\nracks using cut nails and spikes for pro-\njectiles. Sergeant George who command\ned the garrison, ordered all the. fire from\nthe barracks to be concentrated on this can\nnon for the purpose of silencing 1t. and after\ntwo voleys had been fired succeeded in\nhis purpose. Heavy rifle firing was kept up\nall day and until about II pm. when 1t\nlessened up until daylight Tuesday morn\ning, at which time the heavy firing was re-\nsumed, about am. from the front and\nacross the river from the cannon. the cam\nnon having been changed to this new posi-\nton during the night: but few wel!-di-\nrected shots from the garrison silenced 1t\nfor the time being. Up to this time but one\nman of the garrison had been wounded,\nPrivate Lee, who was shot on the left arm,\nbut a great number of insurgents had been\nkilled. some from their position in trees,\nsome from trying to charge the barracks.\n\n\nAbout this time a large number of in\nsurgents had managed to make their way\ninto the church adjoining the barracks,\nand were causing SO much trouble that 1t\nbecame necessary to silence them Ser\ngeant George called for ten men to charge\nthe church and drive them out. The men\nImmediately responded. and under terri\nbly, heavy fire from all sides they succeeded\nin getting in. and finding nearly hundred\ninsurgents there Immediately poured sew\nIII ;,to tt,ayV, iycr\nDer. By this time all the firing was CEN\ntered the church. and Sergeant George,\nfinding that to remain longer would be\nfatal to his little band. retreated back to\nthe barracks. This brave deed was accom-\nplished without the loss of a single man.\nThe firing became SO heavy and the terri\nBILE strain on the men so great from their\nlong and continuous fighting that 1t re-\nquired them to put forth their greatest ef-\nforts to meet this heavy fire.\n\n\nThe Barracks Fired.\n\n\nabout this time the insurgents had man\naged to regain the church. and from the\nwindows made several unsuccessful efforts\nto set fire to the barracks. Finally they\nmanaged to throw some hemp saturated\nwith oil against the building and succeeded\nIn setting fire to It. All efforts to subdue\nthis fire proved unavailing, and when the\nbuilding became untenable. the heat being\n50 intense, the garrison hastily decided the\nonly course open to them was to make\ndash for the river and attempt to get\nacross. hoping to intrench themselves on\nthe opposite shore. They destroyed every\nthing which would be of value to the In\nsurgents, divided the ammunition between\nthem. cut hole in the floor and dropped\nthrough one at time to the basement be-\nlow. When all of them had gotten through\nthey made a rush for the river. Some OF\nthem were killed before they reached the\nriver. Corporal Carson. with fifteen men.\nImmediately started to build trench, using\ntheir bayonets to dig with. The rest Of the\nmen attempted to cross the river. but were\nall killed while getting in the boat\n\n\nHeld Trench for Two Days.\n\n\nFor two days Corporal Carson and his\nsquad held this trench. fighting all the\ntime against great odds and having two\nmen killed and three wounded. one OF\nwhom. Sergeant Hall. has since died. until\nhe was finally rescued on Thursday morn\ning by Lieutenant Sweeney and his de-\ntachment. His report accompanies this\none and shows the difficulties which he en-\ncountered in the rescue. conservative\nestimate of the number of insurgents killed\nis upward of 900. but have no record Of the\nnumber of wounded. The loss we sustained\nIs eighteen killed and five wounded, one of\nwhom has since died. l also lost q large\namount of ordnance stores. quartermaster\nand commissary supplies, of which 1 will\nsubmit certificate to the officers Of those\ndepartments.",
